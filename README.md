# Java Color Picker
The Java Color Picker was a project created for Comptuer Languages and Implemention course. The project demonstrates use of Java, Java File I/O, and the Swing User Interface library to create a Color Sampler application. The application uses the Model-View-Controller (MVC) Design Pattern to encapsulate the application's business logic and user interface componenets for maintainability of the application. The business logic of the application is encapsulated within the `application_model` class and user interface components are encapsulated in the `application_view` class.
